#Flex-And-Bison

A project to gather my training, experiments and programs using Flex and Bison.

Makes use of *Flex & Bison* by John Levine. Copyright 2008 O'Reilly Media, Inc. 978-0-596-15597-1 

A quick summary of the content :

From the book : 

* wc : the same as the unix wc utility
* calculator : parses the input and makes calculation
  * lex file for just outputing and checking output
  * lex file for tokkenization
  * bison file for parsing (not tested yet)

From me :

* match_url : greps the urls in stdout
* template : template for newer files
